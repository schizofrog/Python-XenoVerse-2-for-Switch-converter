Important Notes:
CPK Tool Path: The script assumes you have a tool that can convert mod files into .cpk format. You'll need to replace 'path_to_your_cpk_tool' with the actual path to the CPK tool you want to use.
Mod Compatibility: This script doesn’t check for mod compatibility on its own. It simply organizes the files. You’ll need to ensure that the mods you're using are compatible with the Switch version of the game.
File Organization: You might need to tweak the file classification logic (e.g., handling .anm, .tex, etc.) based on the specific mod you're working with.
This script will save you time by automating the most repetitive part of modding, letting you focus on creating or selecting mods instead of manually organizing them into the correct structure and converting them.
